# Tesla-clone-website
This is a clone website created using figma as a hands-on experince wher I got to learn as I implemented a project on figma. The site is not to perfection but I did my best to make sure all the components work seamslessly first and that the design is close enough to the actual tesla Model S website. I waas unable to export the frames as code but if you have an idea on how to do so, feel free to reach out and guide me in doing so to help me further my understanding of figma.
**Implementation**
To better see what I accomplished, just follow the link below to open the figma file then click on preview(try and ignore the give permission pop-up request that will arise when you open the link and proceed to preview the project, but if it doesn't allow you to proceed just request for permission and I will grand you permission to view it)
**Tools and assets**
The videos and photos used, I got them directly from the tesla website and other various sources across the web. To acquire the photos and videos on the tesla website, just take your cursor to the asset, right click on it with your mouse/touchpad and click on the **Save as** to export the asset directly to your PC.
